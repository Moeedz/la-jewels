It is recommended to measure the ring size in the evening at room temperature.<br/>2. Chain rings should not be worn too tightly, as finger circumference may vary slightly between summer and winter.<br/>3. For wide rings exceeding 10mm in area, an additional 1-2 sizes will be needed when ordering a custom ring.It is recommended that you visit a store for measurement assistance from a consultant.</p><p></p>"
